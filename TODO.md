### üèóÔ∏è Milestone TSE-0001.1b: Python Services Bootstrapping
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create Python service directory structure following clean architecture
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (REST and gRPC)
- [x] Basic structured logging with levels
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Dockerfile for service containerization
- [x] Update to Python 3.13

**BDD Acceptance**: All Python services can start, respond to health checks, and shutdown gracefully

### üîó Milestone TSE-0001.3c: Python Services gRPC Integration
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (100% complete - ALL tasks done!)
**Priority**: High ‚û°Ô∏è DELIVERED
**Branch**: `feature/TSE-0001.3c-complete-grpc-integration` ‚úÖ READY FOR MERGE

**Completed Tasks** (Full TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle):
- [x] **Task 1**: Create failing tests for configuration service client integration ‚úÖ (RED phase)
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement configuration service client to make tests pass ‚úÖ (GREEN phase)
- [x] **Task 3**: Create failing tests for inter-service communication ‚úÖ (RED phase)
- [x] **Task 4**: Implement inter-service gRPC client communication ‚úÖ (GREEN phase)
- [x] **Task 5**: Refactor and optimize implementation ‚úÖ (REFACTOR phase)
- [x] **Task 6**: Validate BDD acceptance criteria and create completion documentation ‚úÖ (VALIDATION)

**FINAL IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDES**:
- ‚úÖ ConfigurationServiceClient with caching, validation, and performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ InterServiceClientManager with connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns
- ‚úÖ RiskMonitorClient and TradingSystemEngineClient with full gRPC capabilities
- ‚úÖ Service discovery integration for dynamic endpoint resolution
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring with comprehensive metrics collection
- ‚úÖ Production-ready error handling and resource management
- ‚úÖ Complete data models for all inter-service communication types
- ‚úÖ Constants module for centralized configuration management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation script demonstrating all functionality

**BDD Acceptance**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Python services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1b (Python Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Configuration Service Client**: Create client to fetch configuration from central config service
- **Service Discovery Integration**: Use existing ServiceDiscovery to find configuration service endpoint
- **Inter-Service Communication**: Implement gRPC client calls to other Python services (risk-monitor, trading-system-engine)
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD with failing tests first, then implementation to make tests pass
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when services unavailable, retry mechanisms
- **Observability**: Performance monitoring and structured logging for all service-to-service calls
